  > 　　　Initially, my first concern about the thesis arises from the fact that accepting others advices help harmonize the interpersonal relationship with teammates.As people share their opinions with us,it is really offensive to reject their willingness,intensifying the possibility of unsatisfaction of others.On the other hand,your demand of others' assistence means your recognition of their working abilities.Such recognition contribute to the improvement of office relationship ,leading to the increasingly working efficiency of the whole team.**A survey conducted by Technical University of Munich, a university prestigious for its leading role in Business field and for its advanced researching results in the relavant field, indicates that an accelerating number of company leaders tend to let employee's publish their opinions when making desicions, which shows an upward trend compared with the studies in the past few years.**There is no exaggeration to say that gathering others wisdom can enhance the relationship of people.
