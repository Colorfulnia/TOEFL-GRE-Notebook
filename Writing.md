## Issue

## Arguments

* specific evidence
* questionable assumptions
* questions to be answered
* alternative explanations

### type 4 : alternative explanations

#### [Introduction]

* 第一句 : 题中说明的conclusion  - 非得分点 注意改写后 信息错误 
  * It is concluded that [名词化] the smaller number sick days Leeville worker takes and Leeville's the proportionally fewer diagnosis of stress-related illness.are credited to [...].
* 第二句 : summary 套路
  * However , the line of reasoning leading to the conclusion suffers a number of limitations.
  * However, there are explanations alternative to the proposed explanation, and these alternative explanations could also account for the two factors.

#### [Body] - EXP.在常识上最有可能 构思比较巧妙的

#### ! comment : 结构 : 总+分 两段 各一个 factor

* In terms of the first fact,there are multiple other reasons behind the first phenomenon.


* First,natural environment that is more favorable to health than Masonton's natural environment.For example, if the air and  water quality in the small town of Leeville is higher than that of Masonton since[less industrialization in the small town/it is common sense that small town is less industrialized, it is probably not the relaxed pace of life but the better air and water that respond for the fewer sick days Leeville workers take.
* The second probable situation that could explain the phenomenon is that Leeville workers  don't take time off work when sick. 
  * For example , they do not take sick days when they have ailments because of their good work ethics or they may not realize illness and thus stay on their posts.
* In Addition,It is likely that Masonton workers use illness as the excuse for time-off. In other words,the number of days on which Masonton workers are actually ill may be the same as that of the sick days taken by Leeville workers, and the additional sick days when Masonton workers off work are taken for other reasons and using illness as the excuse.
* Another possible reason  The size of the population of workers may be another possible reason that a few sick workers,who work in Masonton, take more sick days than many sick workers ,who work in Leeville.


### type 2 : questionable assumptions

#### [Introduction]

* [第一句] conclusion]It is concluded that a jazz music club in Monroe would be an immensely lucrative business.
* [第二句(套话)]However, the line of reasoning contains a number of questionable assumptions,rendering the conclusion logically untenable. [render + n. + adj.]

#### [Body] add up 说得通(逻辑上) what - why - how

* local people & outsiders 
* the decrease of population 
* national average & local average
* [Monroe may not be a market that is able to sustain/supply/maintain/supply a Jazz  club that intends to make enormous profits since there are not enough consumers./not a niche market,first because the local popularity of jazz music is in question.
* The alleged local popularity of jazz music is the first place where the argument is vulnerable.
* To demonstrate/indicate the popularity of Jazz music in Monroe, the author assumes that the 100000 people who attended Monroe's jazz festival last summer are local people and the same attendance can be expected in each of the future years.These questionable assumptions cannot be concrete base on which the author assert/argues/believes the popularity of jazz music,because the festival is so popular that may have attracted people from other cities and the attendance possibly happened last year alone.[a certain portion of them may come from other cities.]In other words, Monroe's local residents may not be as interested in jazz music as the author thought, and the future attendance of the festival may not be as large as it was last year.[In this case,Monroe may not be a market that is able to sustain/supply/maintain/supply a Jazz  club that intends to make enormous profits since there are not enough consumers./not a niche market.]
* Second,based on the underlying assumption that "jazz Nightly" has high ratings and attracts listeners with its Jazz music,the author see the fact that the highest-rated radio program in Monroe is "Jazz Nightly" also failed to indicate the local popularity of Jazz music.However,the highest ratings of the programs are due to the low rating of other local programs when the program has a small listenership,and it is not the jazz music but other elements,such a popular host, a popular segment, that attract the listeners.
* Another assumptions is that musicians reside in Monroe since they own homes in the city.However,what the author assumes is not necessarily the case, because a home in Monroe  may be one of the many properties  a musician owns but not the musician;s regular residence.As a result may disappoint jazz music fans because the absence of those famous musicians.

#### [conclusion]

* In conclusion,there are multiple flaws,questionable assumptions,in the line of reasoning.As a result,Monroe may not be a market that is able to sustain/supply/maintain/supply a Jazz  club that intends to make enormous profits since there are not enough consumers./not a niche market,first because the local popularity of jazz music is in question.
